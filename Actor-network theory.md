A theory developed by [[Bruno Latour]].

According to Wikipedia:

***Actor–network theory** (**ANT**) is a theoretical and methodological approach to [social theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_theory "Social theory") where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationships. It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans. ANT holds that social forces do not exist in themselves, and therefore cannot be used to explain social phenomena. Instead, strictly empirical analysis should be undertaken to "describe" rather than "explain" social activity. Only after this can one introduce the concept of social forces, and only as an abstract theoretical concept, not something which genuinely exists in the world.*

In design it can be applied with the following perspective:

*The actor–network theory can also be applied to design, using a perspective that is not simply limited to an analysis of an object's structure. From the ANT viewpoint, design is seen as a series of features that account for a social, psychological, and economical world. ANT argues that objects are designed to shape human action and mold or influence decisions. In this way, the objects' design serves to mediate human relationships and can even impact our morality, ethics, and politics.*

**Reminds me of**

This reminds me of [[Jenny Davis theory of affordances]] in the sense that objects and technologies influence the creation of social situations as much as humans do.

It also reminds me of [[Cybernetics]], mostly the thought of [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Indigenous relational ontologies]]

**Genealogy**

Apparently, it is a response to [[post-structuralism]], which in itself is a response to [[Structuralism]]
