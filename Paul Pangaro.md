Researcher, professor and practitioner studying [[human-computer interaction]], [[interaction design]], with theoretical grounds deeply rooted in [[Cybernetics]]. 

In his words: 

*I want an intersection of design, humanities, and theory to generate richer human interactions, with technology and without. I have sought, studied, and contributed explanatory models of interaction that aid understanding of human-to-human and human-with-machine conversation. These models have proved valuable for teaching design, writing code, evolving organizations, and proposing new methods for the design process itself. Framing situations as systems that are animated by social actors leads unavoidably to ethics. I am committed to defining minimal axioms for design that bound ethical and humane interactions.*

*I have taught systems and cybernetics to designers â€” specifically, how to model interaction and conversation to aid the design of products and services.*
