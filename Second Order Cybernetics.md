[[Cybernetics]] applied to itself, or the use of cybernetics to study cybernetics. the The cybernetics of self-adaptive complex systems. Developed by [[Margaret Mead]] and others.

From my understanding, cybernetics introduced the concepts of regulation and [[feedback]] from a perspective where the scientist can observe and understand what is going on. But the most complex cybernetic systems are not knowable from an external and objective perspective. Second order cybernetics developed the concepts of self-regulation, self-reference, self-organization to understand the complex systems.
