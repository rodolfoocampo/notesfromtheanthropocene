Most of the efforts in [[Artificial intelligence]] have sought to make computers as smart, or smarter than humans. In contrast, Artificial intelligence augmentation (AIA) seeks to make artificial intelligence that augment human capacities. These intelligent algorithms don't replicate human intelligence, instead, they have a [[new type of intelligence]]. 

**Why is this important?**

One of the greatest risks of AI is the automation of human work. But this is a result of our design paradigm, where human intelligence is the model to replicate and ultimately sought to be replaced. Instead, we should seek [[AI that complements rather than replaces.]]

**Tools for thought?**

Some authors view call AI in the context of AIA as [[tools for thought]] for humans. I really like the tools for thought concept when it refers to non-intelligent software. However, I don't like the idea of understanding and designing AI as merely tool. If we conceive AI as a tool at our service, it will also treat as such when they become smarter [[AI hierarchy inversion]]. In [[The Human Use of Human Being]] Norbert Wiener warned us about treating humans as tools, but perhaps we should also be wary of trating AI as a tool. Instead, I think we need a model where we [[make kin with the machines]].
