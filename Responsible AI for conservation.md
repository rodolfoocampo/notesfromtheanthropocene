Paper:

Responsible [[artificial intelligence]] for conservation.

The paper discusses the potential, but mainly focus on the potential misuses of AI in conservation. 

Examples:

Outcomes of bias in data and implementing one model into another scenario. 
Using accuracy metrics as the only evaluation. For example, 98% classification of animals does not tell you much about the context, species. 

**Main takeaway**

For the [[CSIRO paper]], I think it is useful to mention that a potential risk is wanting to implement the system as is. It needs to be adapted. 

I think it can also be included to discuss the promise of AI.
