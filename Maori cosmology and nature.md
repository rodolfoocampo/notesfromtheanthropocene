Maori's view is that "all the elements of the natural world, the sky father and earth mother and their offspring; the seas, sky, forests and birds, food crops, winds, \[...\], as well as people and wars are descended from a common ancestor, the supreme god."

Something common among indigenous cultures is the concept of [[extended kinship]].
Hurting the natural world is equivalent to hurting one of your kin.
