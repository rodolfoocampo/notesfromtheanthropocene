An approach to [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Indigenous knowledge and AI]]:

*Two-Eyed AI is a label for a framework that would guide the ethical implications development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It draws on the Two-Eyed Seeing principle advanced by Canadian Indigenous leaders, notably Mi'kmaw Elders Albert and Murdena Marshall. Two-Eyed Seeing, Etuaptmuâ€™k in the Mi'kmaw language, refers to learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing and from the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledges and ways of knowing. Two- Eyed AI echoes this approach with a call to consider ethical issues and their management in tandem with the advancement and deployment of AI systems.

But more than this, Two-Eyed AI would embrace integrated thinking, respectful multidisciplinary collaboration, and transcending combinations of interests for public good.*
