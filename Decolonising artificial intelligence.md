Perhaps a way forward in decolonizing [[artificial intelligence]] is by incorporating [[Indigenous relational ontologies]] that view the world as a set of relations rather than a set of hierarchical categories, a prevalent view in the West (see: [[Categorical and hierarchical Western ontologies]]). This would naturally lead to [[Artificial intelligence augmentation]], where artificial intelligence does not seek to replicate and replace human intelligence, but instead complement it by having a different type of intelligence. In this way, humans and computers would work together.
