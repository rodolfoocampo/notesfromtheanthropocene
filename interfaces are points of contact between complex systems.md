An idea developed by [[Benjamin Bratton]] which states that an interface is any point of contact between two [[complex systems]] that governs the conditions of exchange between those systems.

They connect and disconnect in equal measure, structuring flows by combining and segmenting it, enabling it or frustrating it, bridging unlike forms over vast distances and subdividing that which would otherwise congeal on its own.

Reminds me of:
[[Actor-network theory]], particularly the concept of flows along the network.
