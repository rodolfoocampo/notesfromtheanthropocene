There are multiple types of intelligence's, not only in human brains but in elsewhere, within and without ourselves. 

For example, for [[Douglas Engelbart]] there are no specific boxes where we can find intelligence. Intelligence is distributed throughout the system organization hierarchy. In case of biological based intelligence we have conscious level (the one we have direct experience), then subconsciousness psych level, brain modular level, module organization level, cellular level, natural physical phenomena level. But the same is true for computers, who can have different types of intelligent behavior. (See: [[Engelbart's Augmenting Human Intellect]])

With AI, we are not creating human intelligence, we are creating a new type of intelligence. This intelligence is capable of rapid mathematical calculation and the generation, and exploration of multiple possibilities. However, it is not culturally situated. The experience of a human life, and the cultural and social intelligence one learns through it cannot be recreated. One can try to code it, but the nature of culture is that it changes, and the subject who experiences is part of it. We change with it as we change it. Encoding it just externalising our current understanding.
