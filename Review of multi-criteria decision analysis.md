Paper reviewing and outlining Multi-criteria Decision Analysis. 

Abstract: 

*Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a method to support decision-making, by exploring the balance between the pros and cons of different alternatives to ac-complish a specific goal. It assists in framing decision problems, illustrating the per-formance of alternatives across criteria, exploring trade-offs, formulating a decision and testing its robustness. This paper provides a structured review of empirical applications of MCDA to nature conservation published in the scientific literature over the last 20 years. The paper aims at taking stock of past experiences, and comparing them with best practices and common pitfalls identified in the literature, to provide recommendations for better MCDA application to conservation.*

This will be useful as the [[CSIRO paper]] is essentially a method of MCDA. 

I found it referenced in the [[Algorithmic conservation in a changing climate]] paper.
