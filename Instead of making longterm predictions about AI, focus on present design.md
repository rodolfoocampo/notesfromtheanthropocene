The field of AI is full of diverging long-term opinions. From those who believe AI will anhilate the human race, to those who believe we will merge with it and become Homo Deus. We cannot know which one is correct. Even the most important AI researchers [have been wrong](https://slate.com/technology/2021/05/artificial-intelligence-moonshots-usually-fail.html) time and time and again. But they have been wrong. We can seldom predict the long term future technological developments. What we can do is make design decisions in the present. for the products that we already have in front of us. I believe the best present design decision we can do for AI systems is to focus on [[Artificial intelligence augmentation]]
