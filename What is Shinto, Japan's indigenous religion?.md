Shintoism is considered the indigenous religion of Japan  (although some argue is not a formal religion) and provides a backbone to much of the Japanese ideology. 

One of Shinto's central characteristics is the worship of nature. What can be understood as the gods, or the sacred, or their spirits are called Kami. Kami are divine objects commonly drawn from nature, including beings and natural forces. 

Some consider it a pantheist and animist religion.
