Excellent paper outlining applications of algorithms and [[artificial intelligence]] in [[conservation]], from data classification to [[decision science]], with a focus on the implications of [[algorithmic decision making]], and putting it in a broader [[climate change]] context.

*As climate change rapidly alters biological processes, AI has been applied to more precisely document the ecological impacts of environmental change through improved and automated data collection and classification workflows [20â€“23]. Advocates of these technologies argue that data at higher temporal and spatial resolutions alongside more powerful analysis methods will result in better environmental outcomes and assist in finding solutions to complex global environmental issues like climate change and biodiversity loss [24,25]. Over the past decade, applications of AI to climate and conservation science have primarily focused on providing more relevant realtime data [26].*

**Key ideas:**

Algorithms have enabled the collection of data at higher temporal and spatial scales.
Beyond data classification, algorithms are can be used in decision-making for conservation, going from static to dynamic optimisation. 
However, these algorithms can shift power structures, for example, towards those who design the algorithms, or the groups who can get their priorities reflected in them. It can also risk the existence of participative mapping.
