Spanish philosopher and former child prodigy (wrote books about [[Egyptian civilization]] at 13 years old). 

His work focus on intellectual contributions of civilizations, [[integrating knowledge]], rationalism and religious beliefs. I am most interested about him for his interest in understanding [[Creativity]] and how human individuals and civilisations create new concepts.
