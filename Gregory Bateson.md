One of the most fundamental thinkers in [[systems theory]] and [[cybernetics]]. He developed the concepts [[Ecological anthropology]]. He viewed the world as a series of interacting complex systems: individuals, societies, ecosystems, among others and each of these systems has adaptive changes which depend upon [[feedback loops]] to control balance, or homeostasis.

He saw the root of system collapses as a result of [[Categorical and hierarchical Western ontologies]]. 

According to Bateson, [[consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individual, society and ecology]]. This reminds me of the concept of interface put forward by [[Benjamin Bratton]] in [[The Stack]]. [[interfaces are points of contact between complex systems]]
