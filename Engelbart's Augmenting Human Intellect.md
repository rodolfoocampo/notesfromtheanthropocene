[[Douglas Engelbart]] argues that as humanity's problems become more complex, we need tools that augment our intellect to deal with them. From a [great summary](https://medium.com/singularity-log/augmenting-human-intellect-a-conceptual-framework-dc48922c51bc) I found online: 

*The problem Engelbart invites us to tackle is urgent. Complexity of civilization organization and challenges we are discovering is growing exponentially and human intelligence, even though it is growing, is not growing fast enough. Especially human collective intelligence. As a result human civilization is not prepared to face complex challenges of today and tomorrow.*

This is the basis for the concept of [[Artificial intelligence augmentation]] developed later by Nielsen and Carter in [[Using AI to augment human intelligence]]
