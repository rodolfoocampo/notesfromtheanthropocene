According to Wikipedia: 

*Structuralism proposes that one may understand human culture by means of a structure modeled on language and that this understanding differs from concrete reality and from abstract ideas by proposing, instead, a "third order" that mediates between the two.*

Philosophy Now defines it as:

*A simple explanation of structuralism is that it understands phenomena using the metaphor of language. That is, we can understand language as a system, or structure, which defines itself in terms of itself. There is no language ‘behind’ language with which we understand it, no metalanguage to explain what language means. Instead it is a self-referential system. Words explain words explain words (as in a dictionary), and meaning is present as a set of structures.*

Main authors:
[[Levi-Strauss]], who argued against human freedom and explained how human behavior is determined by certain structures. He examined the concept of [[kinship]] and looked at kinship systems from a structural point of view and demonstrated how apparently different social organizations were different permutations of a few basic kinship structures
