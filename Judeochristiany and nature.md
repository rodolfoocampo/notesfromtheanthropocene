In agricultural societies, certain beliefs about human's relation to nature emerged to justify our activities. Gods were placed above nature instead of as a part of it, and these Gods gave nature to us, either to exploit or steward, but ultimately, as human property. Genesis 9:3: "Everything that lives and moves shall be meat for you". In the Christian view, the natural world was created for humans.

This ontologies was extended in industrial societies. Enlightenment thinkers like Aquinas, Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke and Montesquieu further cemented this view by building a hierarchy where the industrial man is the pinnacle of progress and evolution. Humans come from an undesirable state of nature, and our main existential achievement as a race is our ability to tame and dominate this nature.

This is in contrast with [[Indigenous relational ontologies]].
