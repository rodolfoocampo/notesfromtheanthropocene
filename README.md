# Notes from the anthropocene

Networked thoughts, a second brain, an repository of knowledge, a connectome of ideas exploring this weird time that this ape got to live some have deemed the anthropocene. When I say anthropocene, I mean something beyond the geological age, to me is a planetary Zeitgeist, its the art, the technology, the ideas that our species has created in such a short period of time. Understanding the anthropocene, of course, not only involves not only exploring the present, as complex and interesting as it is. It involves udnerstanding what came before it, and speculate what will come after.

These notes are al rendered in Obsidian, and they are all interconnected. One day, i'll put them in my website.
