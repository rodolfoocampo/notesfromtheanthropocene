I found this idea in an essay called [Making Kin the Machines](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/lewis-arista-pechawis-kite/release/1) in which the authors advocate that AI design can benefit greatly from [[Indigenous relational ontologies]] and the concept of [[extended kinship]]. 

In essence, it contrasts Western ontologies that out man at the center (see: [[Categorical and hierarchical Western ontologies]])) with that of indigenous ontologies around the globe that see humans as part of an interconnected whole. In this view, kinship is extended to the non-human. Could this include the machines? I do not think this necessarily means that we have to assign personhood to computers just yet, but this intuition could guide design decisions today. For example, I believe that [[Artificial intelligence augmentation is more compatible with indigenous relational ontologies]] rather than classical [[artificial intelligence]].
